00:00.000 --> 00:08.906
We'll drag the existing layer to the New button on the 
bottom of the layers panel to create a new copy.

00:08.906 --> 00:14.167
Now we'll go to the Filter menu and choose Gaussian Blur.

00:14.167 --> 00:22.907
We'll change the blur amount just enough so we lose a 
little detail of the image.

00:22.907 --> 00:33.670
Now we'll double-click on the layer to edit the layer.

00:33.670 --> 00:41.928
And we'll change the blending mode to overlay. This allows 
the original layer underneath to show through.

00:41.928 --> 00:48.812
We can then adjust the amount of the effect by changing 
the opacity.

00:48.812 --> 00:57.507
And now we have a slightly enhanced image.
