                    The first big rule in sales is that if the person leaves empty-handed,
                    they're likely not going to come back. That's why you have to be 
                    somewhat aggressive when you're working with a customer, but you have
                    to make sure you don't overdo it and scare them away.
                </p>

                    One way you can keep a conversation going is to avoid asking questions
                    that have yes or no answers. For example, if you're selling a service
                    plan, don't ever ask &ldquo;Are you interested in our 3 or 5 year 
                    service plan?&rdquo; Instead, ask &ldquo;Are you interested in the 3
                    year service plan or the 5 year plan, which is a better value?&rdquo;
                    At first glance, they appear to be asking the same thing, and while 
                    a customer can still opt out, it's harder for them to opt out of 
                    the second question because they have to say more than just
                    &ldquo;no.&rdquo;
