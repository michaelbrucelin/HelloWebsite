Loved for its offbeat tone that permeated the telecom space in the early 2000s, Vonage made a name on its ability to reinvent the way people communicate using technology. But with the decline of the residential home phone market, Vonage dared to rethink the future of its business. Never one to sit still, Vonage evolved through a series of mergers and acquisitions that allowed it to move into software as a service and from residential customers to businesses – a seismic shift that required an equally powerful brand evolution, developed in partnership with global branding agency Wolff Olins.&quot;</p>
